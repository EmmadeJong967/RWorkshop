## What R is

<img src="assets/images/01_Rlogo.svg" width = "150" style="float:right">

R is:

- A statistical programming, computation, and graphics **system**,
- Its own **language** (code-based programming/commands),
- A cross platform system (windows, mac, unix-like),
- Freely available online,
- A modular **system**

## A very brief history

- R first appeared in 1993
- Originally written by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman *(University of Auckland, NZ)*
- Influenced by the existing languages S and Scheme
- Mid 1997, 'R core team' established -  maintain the base code
- R CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) 
    - A collection of sites (mirrored daily around the world) that manages the distribution of R and its packages
- R V1.0 released 2000-02-29 *(stable)*

## R more recently

- Over 10,000 R 'add-on' packages (libraries) on CRAN
    - +bioconductor, +github etc
- RStudio initially released in 2011
    - *integrated development environment*
- Annual conference 
    - useR! (2018 Brisbane, 2019 Toulouse)
- [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/)

## R more recently

<img src="assets/images/01_rstudio_logo.png" width = "200" style="float:right">

- 200? enter Hadley Wickham
    - ggplot package
    - plyr package
- Chief Scientist at RStudio
    - Kiwi
    - Developed many packages
    - Written many books (R for Data Science, Advanced R)
        - Freely available online

## R more recently

<img src="assets/images/01_tidyverse.png" width = "150" style="float:right">

- Tidyverse
    - controversy
    - base *vs* tidyverse

## What R isn't?

R is not a:

- data collection tool
- (permanent) data storage system

# R - How to get setup and use R

## But first - Disclaimer

- There are **many ways** to use R
- There are **many ways** to do **most** operations R
- This presentation focuses on the collective 'best practice' advice of our team of daily R users
- R is rapidly evolving
- Online help/guides are often out-of-date 

## Interacting with R

- R is an interactive language
    - Type a command, submit, immediate response (line-by-line)
- Typically, commands saved in a plain text file (.R)
- Commands can be executed in bulk
    - Large scale analysis/data manipulation
    - 'one-click' reports <mark>*(like these slides)*</mark>

## And - a heads up

- R is a cAsE sensitive language
- R is largely forgiving with where white space is (or isn't!)
    - including line breaks, bracket placement etc

## Installing R

- Download R for your OS
    - [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- You will need admin rights
- Download RStudio (optional, well, not really)
    - [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

## RStudio IDE

```{r, echo = F, out.extra = "figure", out.width = "75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("assets", "images", "01_rstudio_ide.png"))
```

## RStudio IDE

- *free and open-source integrated development environment for R*
- Screen divided into quarters, typically
    - One for your code (commands)
    - One for your console (commands executed/results shown)
    - One for your environment management
    - One for your plots/help

## RStudio IDE  

- Customisable and quite diverse
- Ready access to:
    - Terminal, code repository, package management, file management
- Other benefits including
    - Code highlighting (full-featured)
    - Customisable settings (load/save session)
    - Tab completion

## RStudio IDE

```{r, echo = F, out.extra = "figure", out.width = "75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("assets", "images", "01_rstudio_ide.png"))
```

## RStudio IDE

```{r, echo = F, out.extra = "figure", out.width = "100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("assets", "images", "01_rstudio_ide3_large.png"))
```

# Basic syntax 

## Basic syntax - assign

- Assign '<code><-</code>'
    - less than sign followed by dash
    - puts the right hand side into the left hand side
    
<code>a <- 3</code>

- <code>a</code> will now be 3 *(which we'll see shortly)*
- You can use '<code>=</code>' in place of '<code><-</code>'
- Typically we only use '<code>=</code>' within brackets
    - It's complicated and related to environments (scoping)

## Basic syntax - operations

- basic math

```{r}
3+3
3*3
```

## Basic syntax - operations

```{r}
a <- 3
a + a
```

## Basic syntax - brackets

- Round brackets <code>(something) | (x, y)</code>
    - multiple things inside, separated by a comma
    - typically used to group/provide <mark>arguments</mark> for a function
    
```{r}
sum(1, 2, 3, 4, NA, 5, na.rm = T)
```

## Basic syntax - brackets

- Square brackets <code>[something] | [ ] [,] [[ ]]</code>
    - multiple things inside, separated by a comma
    - typically used for <mark>indices</mark> when navigating *within* a structure

```{r}
c("one", "two", "three")[2]
```

## Basic syntax - brackets

- Curly brackets <code>{something}</code>
    - groups multiple <mark>lines of code</mark> 
    - typically used when creating functions

```{r echo = T}
facts_about <- function(x){
  paste0(x, " is awesome")
}
facts_about("matt")
```

## Basic syntax - other

- Colon <code>:</code> used to create a sequence
    - <code>1:4</code> produces <code>1 2 3 4</code>
    - *double colon to access functions in libraries that aren't loaded*
- Hashtag for comments <code># For this next bit of code online somewhere</code>
    - Code won't be executed
- Question mark <code>?something</code> for help
    - Double question mark to search for commands

## Basic syntax - other

- The letters <code>T</code> and <code>F</code> are 'reserved' - logicals
    - indicate <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code> respectively, don't overwrite them
    - used regularly within <mark>arguments</mark>
- Working directory 
    - <code>getwd()</code> and <code>setwd()</code>
    - best practise is using relative directory paths!

# Classes
## Classes

- Each data point (value within a cell) will have a class.
- There are many classes, most (and the common ones) are nice and clear.
- Classes have, somewhat of, a hierarchy 
    - character is King/Queen amongst many
- Classes are closely related to Structures (the next topic).
- Functions will respond differently based on the class of data you feed them.
- Sometimes referred to as <code>mode</code>

## Classes - character

- <code>character</code> is the highest-level 'catch-all' class
- Free text fields will be of class <code>character</code>
- Any* data point that has something other than numbers in it will default to being of class <code>character</code>

*data points with non-nuermic (alpha) characters can be made into other classes (more to come) 

## Classes - character

```{r}
x <- "Teach me R"
x
class(x)
```

- Note the quote marks

## Classes - character

```{r error = T}
x <- Teach me R
```

- Note the lack of quote marks

## Classes - character

```{r error = T}
x <- "Teach me R"
y <- "Teach me now"
x + y
```

## Classes - character

```{r}
x <- "3"
class(x)
```

- Interesting?

## Classes - numeric (integer/double)

- There are three classes that can all be thought of as "numbers"
    + <code>numeric</code>
    + <code>double</code> (double precision floating point numbers - computer format)
    + <code>integer</code> (no decimals)
- R may convert between the three as it sees fit

- *"it is perfectly feasible to use R successfully for years and not need to know the answer to this question"* - stackoverflow

## Classes - numeric (integer/double)

```{r}
x <- "3"
x
class(x)
```

- Oh, quotes!

## Classes - numeric (integer/double)

```{r}
x <- 3
x
class(x)
x + 2
```

## Classes - numeric (integer/double)

```{r}
x <- as.integer(3.1)
x
class(x)
```

- Notice the decimal has dropped off?

## Classes - numeric (integer/double)

```{r}
x <- as.integer(3.1); x + 0.4
class(x + 0.4)
```
- Notice the decimal is really gone (not in memory)

## Classes - factor

- Class <code>factor</code> is used when there is a limited set of responses
    - e.g. likert scales, States, income brackets
- Generally have <code>labels</code>, associated with <code>levels</code> (the responses)
- <mark>Always</mark> have an underlying number linked to each <code>label</code>/<code>level</code>
- <mark>Can</mark> be <code>ordered</code>, but don't have to be
    - Default behaviour is to handle alphabetically
- Useful for creating tables, coefficients in models etc 

## Classes - factor

```{r}
y <- c("Cat", "Other", "Dog", "Dog"); y
class(y)
```

## Classes - factor

```{r}
y <- as.factor(c("Cat", "Other", "Dog", "Dog")); y
```

- note, the **order** of the levels

## Classes - factor

```{r}
class(y); levels(y)
```

## Classes - factor

```{r}
y <- y[-1]; y  # get rid of the cat
table(y)
```

## Classes - factor

```{r}
y <- as.factor(y); levels(y)
y <- factor(y); levels(y)
```

## Classes - logical

- Class <code>logical</code> variables can only take two*, <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>
- Can usefully be abbreviated as <code>T</code> and <code>F</code> 
- Generally used as a selection mechanism 
    - records in/out
    - conditional (<code>if</code>) statements
- Work well with <code>sum()</code>, <code>any()</code>, <code>all()</code>
- Be aware of combined logicals!
    - <code>F + F + NA</code> = ?
    - <code>all(c(T, NA, T))</code> = ?

## Classes - logical

```{r error = T}
y <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
class(y)
```

```{r error = T}
table(y)
```

## Classes - logical

```{r error = T}
F + F + NA
```

```{r error = T}
T + NA + T
```

## Classes - logical

```{r error = T}
F + F + F
```

```{r error = T}
T + T + T
```

```{r error = T}
sum(T, F, T)
```

## Classes - logical

```{r error = T}
y <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE); table(y)
sum(y)
```

## Classes - logical

```{r error = T}
all(c(T, NA, T))
all(c(F, NA, F))
```

## Classes - logical

```{r error = T}
any(c(T, NA, T))
any(c(F, NA, F))
all(c(T, F, T))
```

## Classes - date

- Class <code>date</code> follows relatively strict formatting
- Can also include time
    - via 'associated' classes <code>POSIXct</code>, <code>POSIXlt</code>
    - be aware of timezones
- Relatively nice syntax for coverting strings to dates
- Has many helper funtions to aid date math
- Lubridate!
- Go slow!

## Classes - date

- <code>?strptime</code> can be your friend
    - *Date-time Conversion Functions to and from Character*
      
<code>%d Day of the month as decimal number (01–31).</code>

<code>%e Day of the month as decimal number (1–31), ...</code>

<code>%H Hours as decimal number (00–23). ... </code>

<code>%y Year without century (00–99). 
On input, values 00 to 68 are prefixed by 20 and 69 to 99 by 19...</code>

<code>%Y Year with century. Note that whereas there was no zero in the original Gregorian calendar...</code>

## Classes - date

```{r}
Sys.Date()
```

- Note the structure
- YYYY-MM-DD

## Classes - date

```{r}
class(as.Date("2019-01-31"))
```

```{r}
class(as.Date("31-01-2019"))
```

```{r error = T}
class(as.Date("31.01.2019"))
```

## Classes - date

```{r error = T}
class(as.Date("31.01.2019"))
class(as.Date("31.01.2019", format = "%d.%m.%Y"))
```

## Classes - date | lubridate

- <code>library(lubridate)</code>

```{r message = F, warning = F}
library(lubridate); class(dmy("31.01.2019"))
```

- complex (powerful?) new classes
    - <code>duration</code>, <code>interval</code>, <code>period</code>
    
## Classes - date | lubridate  
    
```{r}
x <- round(interval(ymd("1983-10-16"), Sys.Date()) / years(1), 2)
x
class(x)
```

## Classes - date | lubridate  

```{r}
as.duration(interval(ymd("1983-10-16"), Sys.Date()))
as.period(interval(ymd("1983-10-16"), Sys.Date()))
```

# Data structures 

## Data structures 

- Structure is our term, it is not an R term
- Sometimes referred to as <code>type</code>
- Some structures are a <code>class</code> within R
- But not all 

## Structures - single element

Single element (scalar typically)

- most basic building block
- a cell

```{r}
i <- 1
```

## Structures - vector

- at least two elements
- a <code>vector</code> is not a class
- a <code>vector</code> HAS a class, and it can have only one! (remember the hierarchy)
- the power of R, is vectorised processing 

## Structures - vector | we've already seen a lot!

```{r error = T}
x <- c(3, 4, 5, 6, 8) # c stands for combine/concatenate
x
x + 2
```

## Structures - vector | we've already seen a lot!

```{r error = T}
x <- c(3, 4, 5, 6, 8) # c stands for combine/concatenate
length(x)
sum(x)
```

## Structures - vector | we've already seen a lot!

```{r error = T}
y <- c("Cat", "Dog", "Other", "Dog")
length(y)
sum(y)
```

## Structures - data.frame

- Likely the main* structure you will work with in R
- Best 'pictured' as a table (two-dimensional), with rows and columns
- Best 'thought of' as:
    - a number of | vertical | vectors, side-by-side, bound together, all of equal length
- All elements of a <mark>column</mark> will be off the same class!
- When reading in a csv, a plain text file, (a worksheet of) an excel file
    - it will generally become available to you as a <code>data.frame</code>

* *standby for tibbles*

## Structures - tibble 

- A <code>tibble</code> is functionally very similar to a <code>data.frame</code>
    - Part of the tidyverse
    - Has a "handy" reduced display format

*We'll come back to this*

## Demonstration data set(s)

```{r}
class(tki_demo)
dim(tki_demo)
```

## Demonstration data set(s)

```{r}
head(tki_demo) # can you guess what tail does?
```

## Demonstration data set(s)

```{r}
names(tki_demo)
```

## Structures - data.frame

```{r}
str(tki_demo)
```

## Structures - data.frame

```{r}
summary(tki_demo[, 1:4])
```

## Structures - data.frame

```{r}
tki_demo[1:2 , 1:3]
tki_demo[1 , 1]
```

## Structures - data.frame

```{r error = T}
tki_demo$day1[1:10]
```

## Structures - data.frame

```{r error = T}
tki_demo$index <- 1:nrow(tki_demo)
head(tki_demo[ , c(1, 2, 3, ncol(tki_demo))])
```

## Structures - tibble

- a <code>tibble</code> is the <code>data.frame</code> of the <mark>tidyverse</mark>
- broady the same as a <code>data.frame</code>, but less unruly

```{r echo = T}
load("../data/dat.RData")
```

## Structures - tibble

```{r echo = T}
tki_demo
```

## Structures - tibble

- We're told it's a tibble!
- Given the dimensions by default!
- Given the column classes (str) by default!
- Controled printing (won't blow out your console)

## Structures - tibble

```{r echo = T}
tki_demo
```

## Structures - list

- Best 'pictured' as a 3D (deep) (filing cabinet like) structure 
    - A vector where each element can have a different class/dimension
- Lists can be used to keep related things together rather than as separate objects
    - If you had a <code>data.frame</code> of data for each calendar
    - You can apply operations to call calendar years at the same time
    
## Structures - list

- Lists can be good for collecting output (complex elements) from a loop
    - Model output from running a model on multiple imputed datasets

## Structures - list

```{r}
tki_list <- list(tki_demo,
                 tki_demo_complications)
class(tki_list)
```

## Structures - list

```{r}
head(tki_list[[1]], 2); head(tki_list[[2]], 2) # access elements 
```

## Structures - list

- why? efficiency!

```{r}
lapply(tki_list, head, 1)
```

## Structures - other

**Matrix *(2-dimensions)* **

- A grid like structure (similar to <code>data.frames</code>)
- Entire structure is one class (all <code>numeric</code> or <code>character</code> etc)
- Can not use <code>$</code> for referencing columns (<code>[ , ]</code> used) 

**Array *(n-dimensions)* **

- Like a list, but must be all of the same class

*beyond the scope of this level - computational efficiency*

# Reading and saving data
## Reading data in

- The function you use depends on your file type
- Flat files (plain text files) (<code>.csv, .txt</code>) can be read in with base functions
    - <code>read.csv()</code> and <code>read.table()</code> are commonly use
- Other files require functions from additional packages *(next topic)*
    - The <mark>readxl</mark> package reads in (<code>.xlx, .xlsx</code>) excel files via <code>read_excel()</code>
    - The <mark>foreign</mark> and <mark>haven</mark> packages read in SPSS, Stata, and SAS files
- Tidyverse

## Reading data in - arguments

- <code>header = T</code>
    - Is the top row of your dataset column headers
- <code>na.strings = c("NA", "missing", "999")</code>
    - This will mean cells end up as true R based <code>NA</code> values, which is very handy 
- <code>stringsAsFactors = F</code>
    - Can cause issues if not explicitly set as <code>F</code> (ID codes, free text responses)

## Reading data in - example

<code>
dat <- read.csv("/DIRECTORY/my_data_file.csv", header = T, na.strings = c("NOT CONTACTED"))
</code>

or

<code>
dat <- read.csv("<span style="color:red">..</span>/data/my_data_file.csv", header = T, na.strings = c("NOT CONTACTED"))
</code>

- This will load the csv file into a <code>data.frame</code> called <code>dat</code>
- <code>getwd()</code> and <code>setwd()</code>
- Ensure path is valid (shared drives)

## Reading data in - considerations

- Excel
    - skip lines? data classes (dates?)? 
    - which worksheet(s?) did you want?
- SPSS
    - do you want category labels? or underlying stored values (think factors)?

## Reading data in - considerations

- A single character in a column that isn't <code>0-9</code> or <code>.</code> will typically mean that column is read in as <code>character</code>
- You can load data directly from the web
    - <code>read.csv("http://some.where.net/data/foo.csv")</code>
    - You can use <code>readHTMLTable</code> from the <mark>XML</mark> package to read tables off websites

## Saving within R

- Save all scripts (<code>.R, .Rmd</code>) so you can regenerate your results directly from the original data files
- Saving your <mark>workspace</mark> is commonly done
    - This will include everything within your current session (/environment)
        - All datasets, model output, custom functions, settings changes - but not loaded libraries
- Saved via: <code>save.image("my_session.Rdata")</code>
- Loaded via: <code>load("my_session.Rdata")</code>

## Saving within R

- Save specific (individual) structures/objects on their own (not so commonly done)
    - Saved via: <code>saveRDS(dat, "my_data_frame.RDS")</code>
    - Loaded via: <code>readRDS("my_data_frame.RDS")</code>
- Exporting data via write commands
    - Export via: <code>write.csv(dat, "my_csv_export.csv")</code>
    - Commonly used arguments include <code>row.names = F</code> and <code>na = ""</code>
- Recommend 
    - <code>write.csv(d, <span style="color:red">paste0(Sys.Date(), </span>"_dat.csv"))</code>

# Installing/loading packages

## Packages - overview

- Packages can be thought of as 'bundles of functions'
    - They can contain datasets and other things too
- They extend the functionality of R
    - New graphing abilities, modeling methods, faster data manipulation 
- It's very common for scripts to begin with code loading many packages
- Require semi-regular updating (easy)
- **Beware** of loading packages part-way through a script/session

## Packages - installing and loading

- Installed via: <code>install.packages("ggplot2")</code>
    - *note the quote marks*
    - by default, this will also install that packages <mark>dependencies</mark> 
- Packages loaded for use via: <code>library(ggplot)</code>
    - *note the lack of quote marks*
- Updated via: <code>updated.packages()</code>
    - considered using '<code>ask = F</code>'

## Packages - installing and loading

- Some packages are installed direct from the developer
    - Installed via <code>remotes<span style="color:red">::</span>install_github()</code>
    - That is, using the <code>install_github()</code> function within the <code>remotes</code> package
- Our package is installed this way
    - <code>remotes::install_github("TelethonKids/biometrics", build_vignettes = TRUE)</code>

## Packages - citing and more

- <code>.libPaths()</code> will show where (on your computer) your packages are stored
- <code>citation("ggplot2")</code> will tell you how to cite the package
- Beware of clashes
    - packages overiding base functions, or two packages using the same name for different functions
        - *not overly common, and you will get warned*
- Help file will tell you what package a function resides in
    - <code>?geom_path</code> starts (top left) with '<code>geom_path {ggplot2}</code>'
