## What R is

<img style="float: right;" src="https://cran.r-project.org/Rlogo.svg" width="150">

R is:

- a statistical programming, computation, and graphics **system**,
- it's own **language** (code-based programming/commands),
- a cross platform system (windows, mac, unix-like),
- freely available online,
- a modular **system**

## A very brief history

- R first appeared in 1993
- Originally written by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (University of Auckland, NZ)
- Influenced by the existing languages S and Scheme
- Mid 1997, 'R core team' established to maintain the base code
- R CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) - a collection of sites (mirrored daily around the world) that manages the distribution of R and it's packages
- R V1.0 released 2000-02-29 (considered stable enough for production use)

## R more recently

- 200? enter Hadley Wickham
- Over 10,000 R 'add-on' packages on CRAN
    - More on github
- Rstudio initially released in 2011
- Annual conferences
    - 

## What R isn't?

R is not a:

- designated data collection tool (*?)
- (permanent) data storage system (*?)
- 
# R - How to get setup and use R

## But first - Disclaimer

- There are **many ways** to use R
- There are **many ways** to do **most** operations R
- This presentation focuses on the collective 'best practice' advice of our team of daily R users
- Some other ideas are presented/summarised at the end of this presentation

## Interacting with R

- R is an interactive language
<mark>
- Type a command, submit, immediate response 
    + line by line
</mark>
- Save "data" (used very broadly) in a vast array of formats
- (Typically) commands saved in a plain text file (.R)
- Commands can be submitted in bulk
    + large scale analysis/data manipulation
    + 'one-click' reports

## And - a heads up

- R is a cAsE sensitive language
- R is largely forgiving with where white spaces is (or isn't)
    + including line breaks, bracket placement etc

## Installing R

- Download R for your OS
    + [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- You will need admin rights
- Download RStudio (optional)
    + [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

## RStudio IDE

```{r, echo = F, out.extra = "figure", out.width = "85%"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("assets", "images", "01_rstudio_ide.png"))
```

## RStudio IDE

- Screen divided into quarters, typically
    + One for your code (commands)
    + One for your console (commands executed/results shown)
    + One for your environment management
    + One for your plots/help
- Customisable and quite diverse
    + Terminal, code repository management, package management, file management etc

# R - Fundamentals of R
    + Basic syntax
    + Data classes
    + Reading data in
    + Installing/loading packages
    
## Basic syntax - assign

- Assign '<code><-</code>'
    + less than sign followed by dash
    + puts the right hand side into the left hand side
    
<code>a <- 3</code>

- a will now be 3
- you can use '<code>=</code>' in place of '<code><-</code>'
- typically we only use '<code>=</code>' within brackets
    + it's comlicated and related to environments (scoping)


## Basic syntax - operations

- basic math

```{r}
3+3
3*3
```

- functions

```{r}
sum(1, 2, 3, 4, NA, 5, na.rm = T)
```

## Basic syntax - brackets

- Round brackets <code>(something) | (x, y)</code>
    + multiple things inside, separated by a comma
    + typically used to group <mark>arguments</mark> of a function
- Square brackets <code>[something] | [ ] [,] [[ ]]</code>
    + multiple things inside, separated by a comma
    + typically used for <mark>indices</mark> when navigating *within* a structure
- Curly brackets <code>{something}</code>
    + groups multiple <mark>lines of code</mark> 
    + typically used when creating functions

## Basic syntax - other

- colon <code>:</code> used to create a sequence
    + <code>1:4</code> produces <code>1 2 3 4</code>
    + *double colon to access functions in libraries that aren't loaded*
- hashtag for comments <code># Something</code>
    + code won't be executed
- question mark <code>?something</code> for help
    + double question mark to search for commands

## Basic syntax - other

- The letters <code>T</code> and <code>F</code> are 'reserved' - logicals
    + indicate <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code> respectively
    + used regularly within <mark>arguments</mark>
- Working directory 
    + <code>getwd()</code> and <code>setwd()</code>
    + best practise is using relative directory paths!

## Data classes

- Each data point, which you can think of as a cell, will have a class.
- There are many classes, most (and the common ones) are nice and clear.
- Classes have, somewhat of, a hierarchy [character is King/Queen amongst many]
- Classes are closely related to Structures (the next topic).
- Functions will respond differently based on the class of data you feed them.

## Classes - character

<code>character</code> is the highest-level 'catch-all' class

- Free text fields will be of class <code>character</code>
- Any* data point that has something other than numbers in it will default to being of class <code>character</code>

*data points with non-nuermic (alpha) characters can be made into other classes (more to come) 

## Classes - character

```{r}
x <- "Teach me R"
x
class(x)
```

- Note the quote marks

## Classes - character

```{r error = T}
x <- Teach me R
```

- Note the lack of quote marks

## Classes - character

```{r error = T}
x <- "Teach me R"
y <- "Teach me now"
x + y
```

## Classes - character

```{r}
x <- "3"
class(x)
```

- Interesting?

## Classes - numeric (integer/double)

- There are three classes that (essentially) can all be thought of as <code>numeric</code>
    + <code>numeric</code>
    + <code>double</code> (double precision floating point numbers - computer format)
    + <code>integer</code> (no decimals)
- These are all 'numbers', R may convert between the three as it sees fit
- "it is perfectly feasible to use R successfully for years and not need to know the answer to this question" - stackoverflow

## Classes - numeric (integer/double)

```{r}
x <- "3"
x
class(x)
```

- Oh, quotes!

## Classes - numeric (integer/double)

```{r}
x <- 3
x
class(x)
x + 2
```

## Classes - numeric (integer/double)

```{r}
x <- as.integer(3.1)
x
class(x)
x + 0.4
class(x + 0.4)
```
- Notice the decimal has dropped off

## Classes - factor

- Class <code>factor</code> is used for variables that have a discrete set of categories (ordered or otherwise)
- These can be used where labeling is applied to coded variables (1 = "Cat", 2 = "Dog", 3 = "Other")
- It is **very easy** to trip up with factors
- But, factors can be very useful! a (necessity)?
    + Correct handling within models

## Classes - factor

```{r error = T}
y <- c(Cat, Dog, Other)
y <- c("Cat", "Dog", "Other", "Dog")
y
class(y)
y <- as.factor(c("Cat", "Dog", "Other", "Dog"))
y
class(y)
levels(y)
```

- note, the order of the levels

## Classes - logical

- Class <code>logical</code> variables can only take two*, <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>
- These can be abbreviated as <code>T</code> and <code>F</code> 
- Often used as a selection mechanism (records in/out, in conditional (<code>if</code>) statements)

## Classes - logical






## Classes - factor

```{r}
y <- as.factor(c("Cat", "Dog", "Other", "Dog", "Dog"))
table(x)
y <- y[-1] # get rid of the cat
table(y)
y
y <- as.factor(y)
levels(y)
y <- factor(y)
levels(y)

```

- review <code>?factor</code>
- note, <code>as.factor()</code> does not accept additional arguments, and see <code>levels</code> defaults.

## Classes - date




## Classes - other

## Data structures 

- Structure is our term, it is not an R term
- Some structures are a <code>class</code> within R
- But not all 

Single element (scalar typically)
- most basic building block

```{r}
i <- 1
```

## Structures - vector

- at least two elements
- a <code>vector</code> is not a class
- a <code>vector</code> HAS a class, and it can have only one! (remember the hierarchy)
- the power of R, is vectorised processing 

## Structures - vector

```{r error = T}
x <- c(3,4,5,6,8)
x
x + 2
length(x)
sum(x)
y <- c("Cat", "Dog", "Other", "Dog")
length(y)
sum(y)
```

## Structures - data.frame

- likely the main structure you will work with in R
- best 'pictured' as a table (two-dimensional), with rows and columns
- best 'thought of' as:
    - a number of | vertical | vectors
    - side by side
    - bound together
    - all of equal length
- all elements of a column will be off the same class!
- reading in a csv, a plain text file, (a worksheet of) an excel file
    - it will generally become available to you as a <code>data.frame</code>

## Structures - data.frame

- a <code>tibble</code> is functionally very similar to a <code>data.frame</code>
    - part of the tidyverse
    - has a "handy" reduced display format

## Structures - data.frame

```{r}
class(mtcars)
dim(mtcars)
head(mtcars) # can you guess what tail does?
names(mtcars)
row.names(mtcars)[1:5]
```

## Structures - data.frame

```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

## Structures - data.frame

```{r}
summary(mtcars[, 1:4])
```

## Structures - data.frame

```{r}
head(mtcars)
mtcars[1:2 , 1:3]
mtcars[1 , 1]
```

## Structures - data.frame

```{r}
mtcars$mpg[1:10]
mtcars$MyRating <- 1:32
mtcars$MyRating <- 1:nrow(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

## Structures - list

- these are complex
- best 'pictured' as a 3D (deep) (filing cabinet like) structure 
- each element of the list can have a different class
- lists can be used to keep related things together rather than as separate objects
    - if you had a <code>data.frame</code> of data for each calendar
    - you can apply operations to call calendar years at the same time
- lists can be good for collecting output (complex elements) from a loop
    - model output from running a model on multiple imputed datasets

## Structures - other

Matrix
- 

Array



## Reading data in

- The function you use depends on your file type
- Flat files (plain text files) (<code>.csv, .txt</code>) can be read in with base functions
    + <code>read.csv()</code> and <code>read.table()</code> are commonly use
- Other files require specific packages (next topic)
    + the <mark>readxl</mark> package reads in (<code>.xlx, .xlsx</code>) excel files via <code>read_excel()</code>
    + the <mark>foreign</mark> and <mark>haven</mark> packages read in SPSS, Stata, and SAS files

## Reading data in - arguments

- <code>header = T</code>
    + is the top row of your dataset column headers, normally yes
- <code>na.strings = c("NA", "missing", "999")</code>
    + this will mean cells end up as true R based <code>NA</code> values, which is very handy 
- <code>stringsAsFactors = F</code>
    + can cause issues if not explicitly set as <code>F</code> (ID codes, free text responses)

## Reading data in - example

<code>
dat <- read.csv("/Users/USERNAME/Documents/my_data_file.csv", 
                header = T, na.strings = c("NOT CONTACTED"))
</code>
or
<code>
dat <- read.csv("../data/my_data_file.csv", 
                header = T, na.strings = c("NOT CONTACTED"))
</code>

- This will load the csv file into a <code>data.frame</code> called <code>dat</code>
- Ensure path is valid (shared drives)

## Reading data in - considerations

- Excel
    + skip lines? data classes (dates?)? 
    + which worksheet(s?) did you want?
- SPSS
    + do you want category labels? or underlying stored values (think factors)?
- A single character that isn't <code>0-9</code> or <code>.</code> will mean a variable is read in as character
- You can load data directly from the web
    + <code>read.csv("http://some.where.net/data/foo.csv")</code>
    + you can use <code>readHTMLTable</code> from the <mark>XML</mark> package to read tables off websites

## Packages - overview

- Packages can be thought of as 'bundles of functions'
    + they can contain datasets and other things too
- They extend the functionality of R
    + New graphing abilities, modeling methods, faster data manipulation 
- Well over 10k packages
- Managed by CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)
    + installed from CRAN/CRAN mirrors
- Very common for scripts to start by calling many packages
- Require semi-regular updating (easy)

## Packages - installing and loading

- Installed via: <code>install.packages("ggplot2")</code>
    + note the quote marks
    + by default, this will also install that packages <mark>dependencies</mark> 
- Packages loaded for use via: <code>install.packages(ggplot)</code>
    + note the lack of quote marks
- Updated via: <code>updated.packages()</code>
    + considered using '<code>ask = T</code>'

## Packages - installing and loading

- Lots of packages are installed direct from the developer
    + installed via <code>devtools::install_github()</code>
    + that is, using the <code>install_github()</code> function within the <code>devtools</code> package
- Our package is installed this way
    + <code>devtools::install_github("TelethonKids/biometrics", build_vignettes = TRUE)</code>

## Packages - citing and more

- Running <code>.libPaths()</code> will show where (on your computer) your libraries are stored
- Running <code>citation("ggplot2")</code> will tell you have to cite a package
- Beware of clashes
    + packages overiding base functions, or two packages with the same function
    + not overly common, and you will get warned
- Help file will tell you what package a function resides in
    + Help file for <code>?geom_path</code> starts with <code>geom_path {ggplot2}</code>

## Saving within R

- Save all scripts (<code>.R, .Rmd</code>) so you can *always regenerate your results from your original data files
- Saving your <mark>workspace</mark> is commonly done
    + this will include *everything within your current session (/environment)
    + all datasets, model output, custom functions, settings changes - but not loaded libraries
    + saved via: <code>save.image("my_session.Rdata")</code>
    + loaded via: <code>load("my_session.Rdata")</code>

## Saving within R

- Save specific (individual) structures/object on their own (not commonly done)
    + saved via: <code>saveRDS(dat, "my_data_frame.RDS")</code>
    + loaded via: <code>readRDS("my_data_frame.RDS")</code>
- Exporting data via write commands
    + export via: <code>write.csv(dat, "my_csv_export.csv")</code>
    + commonly used arguments include <code>row.names = F</code> and <code>na = ""</code>

## Important Syntax recap

Many of these have been seen during the prior examples:
- <code><-</code> assign, puts the right hand side into the left hand side
- <code>?</code> followed by a command, to search for help on a command
- <code>a:b</code> used to generate a series of integers, from a to b
- <code></code>
- <code>function( , , ...)</code> **arguments** to a function are seperated by commas
- <code>c()</code> concatenate, used to create a vector
- <code>c()</code> concatenate, used to create a vector
- <code>[ ] [,] [[ ]]</code> used to 'extract'/interact with componets of a  
- <code></code>
- <code></code>
- <code></code>
