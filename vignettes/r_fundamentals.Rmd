# R - What R is

## Overview

<img style="float: right;" src="https://cran.r-project.org/Rlogo.svg" width="150">

R is:

- a statistical programming, computation, and graphics **system**,
- it's own **language** (code-based programming/commands),
- a cross platform system (windows, mac, unix-like),
- freely available online,
- a modular **system**

## More about R



## A very brief history

- R first appeared in 1993
- Originally written by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (University of Auckland, NZ)
- Influenced by the existing languages S and Scheme
- Mid 1997, 'R core team' established to maintain the base code
- R CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) - a collection of sites (mirrored daily around the world) that manages the distribution of R and it's packages
- R V1.0 released 2000-02-29 (considered stable enough for production use)

## R more recently

- 200? enter Hadley Wickham
- Over 10,000 R 'add-on' packages on CRAN
    - More on github
- Rstudio initially released in 2011
- Annual conferences
    - 


## What R isn't?

R is not a:

- designated data collection tool (*?)
- (permanent) data storage system (*?)
- 

# Getting started and the building blocks

## We'll cover
- The RStudio IDE
- Classes
- Structures
- Important Syntax

## But first - Disclaimer

- There are **many ways** to use R
- There are **many ways** to do **most** operations R
- This presentation focuses on the collective 'best practice' advice of our team of daily R users
- Some other ideas are presented/summarised at the end of this presentation

## And - a heads up

- R is a cAsE sensitive language
- R is largely very forgiving with where white spaces is (or isn't)
- R is largely very forgiving with 

## RStudio IDE

## Classes

- Each data point, which you can think of as a cell, will have a class.
- There are many classes, most (and the common ones) are nice and clear.
- Classes have, somewhat of, a hierarchy [character is King/Queen amongst many]
- Classes are closely related to Structures (the next topic).
- Functions will respond differently based on the class of data you feed them.

## Classes - character

<code>character</code> is the highest-level 'catch-all' class

- Free text fields will be of class <code>character</code>
- Any* data point that has something other than numbers in it will default to being of class <code>character</code>

*data points with non-nuermic (alpha) characters can be made into other classes (more to come) 

## Classes - character

```{r}
x <- "Teach me R"
x
class(x)
```

- Note the quote marks

## Classes - character

```{r error = T}
x <- Teach me R
```

- Note the lack of quote marks

## Classes - character

```{r error = T}
x <- "Teach me R"
y <- "Teach me now"
x + y
```

## Classes - character

```{r}
x <- "3"
class(x)
```

- Interesting?

## Classes - numeric (integer/double)

- There are three classes that (essentially) can all be thought of as <code>numeric</code>
    + <code>numeric</code>
    + <code>double</code> (double precision floating point numbers - computer format)
    + <code>integer</code> (no decimals)
- These are all 'numbers', R may convert between the three as it sees fit
- "it is perfectly feasible to use R successfully for years and not need to know the answer to this question" - stackoverflow

## Classes - numeric (integer/double)

```{r}
x <- "3"
x
class(x)
```

- Oh, quotes!

## Classes - numeric (integer/double)

```{r}
x <- 3
x
class(x)
x + 2
```

## Classes - numeric (integer/double)

```{r}
x <- as.integer(3.1)
x
class(x)
x + 0.4
class(x + 0.4)
```
- Notice the decimal has dropped off

## Classes - factor

- Class <code>factor</code> is used for variables that have a discrete set of categories (ordered or otherwise)
- These can be used where labeling is applied to coded variables (1 = "Cat", 2 = "Dog", 3 = "Other")
- It is **very easy** to trip up with factors
- But, factors can be very useful! a (necessity)?
    + Correct handling within models

## Classes - factor

```{r}
y <- c(Cat, Dog, Other)
y <- c("Cat", "Dog", "Other", "Dog")
y
class(y)
y <- as.factor(c("Cat", "Dog", "Other", "Dog"))
y
class(y)
levels(y)
```

- note, the order of the levels

## Classes - logical



## Classes - factor

```{r}
y <- as.factor(c("Cat", "Dog", "Other", "Dog", "Dog"))
table(x)
y <- y[-1] # get rid of the cat
table(y)
y
y <- as.factor(y)
levels(y)
y <- factor(y)
levels(y)

```

- review <code>?factor</code>
- note, <code>as.factor()</code> does not accept additional arguments, and see <code>levels</code> defaults.

## Classes - date




## Classes - other

## Structures 

- Structure is our term, it is not an R term
- Some structures are a <code>class</code> within R
- But not all 

Single element (scalar typically)
- most basic building block

```{r}
i <- 1
```

## Structures - vector

- at least two elements
- a <code>vector</code> is not a class
- a <code>vector</code> HAS a class, and it can have only one! (remember the hierarchy)
- the power of R, is vectorised processing 

## Structures - vector

```{r}
x <- c(3,4,5,6,8)
x
x + 2
length(x)
sum(x)
y <- c("Cat", "Dog", "Other", "Dog")
length(y)
sum(y)
```

## Structures - data.frame

- likely the main structure you will work with in R
- best 'pictured' as a table (two-dimensional), with rows and columns
- best 'thought of' as:
    - a number of | vertical | vectors
    - side by side
    - bound together
    - all of equal length
- all elements of a column will be off the same class!
- reading in a csv, a plain text file, (a worksheet of) an excel file
    - it will generally become available to you as a <code>data.frame</code>

## Structures - data.frame

- a <code>tibble</code> is functionally very similar to a <code>data.frame</code>
    - part of the tidyverse
    - has a "handy" reduced display format

## Structures - data.frame

```{r}
class(mtcars)
dim(mtcars)
head(mtcars) # can you guess what tail does?
names(mtcars)
row.names(mtcars)[1:5]
```

## Structures - data.frame

```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

## Structures - data.frame

```{r}
summary(mtcars[, 1:4])
```

## Structures - data.frame

```{r}
head(mtcars)
mtcars[1:2 , 1:3]
mtcars[1 , 1]
```

## Structures - data.frame

```{r}
mtcars$mpg[1:10]
mtcars$MyRating <- 1:32
mtcars$MyRating <- 1:nrow(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

## Structures - list

- these are complex
- best 'pictured' as a 3D (deep) (filing cabinet like) structure 
- each element of the list can have a different class
- lists can be used to keep related things together rather than as separate objects
    - if you had a <code>data.frame</code> of data for each calendar
    - you can apply operations to call calendar years at the same time
- lists can be good for collecting output (complex elements) from a loop
    - model output from running a model on multiple imputed datasets

## Structures - other

Matrix
- 

Array

## Important Syntax

Many of these have been seen during the prior examples:
- <code><-</code> assign, puts the right hand side into the left hand side
- <code>?</code> followed by a command, to search for help on a command
- <code>a:b</code> used to generate a series of integers, from a to b
- <code></code>
- <code>function( , , ...)</code> **arguments** to a function are seperated by commas
- <code>c()</code> concatenate, used to create a vector
- <code>c()</code> concatenate, used to create a vector
- <code>[ ] [,] [[ ]]</code> used to 'extract'/interact with componets of a  
- <code></code>
- <code></code>
- <code></code>
